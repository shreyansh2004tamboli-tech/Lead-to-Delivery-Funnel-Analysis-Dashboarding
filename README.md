# Lead to Delivery Funnel Analysis & Dashboarding
The task was to analyze the complete Lead-to-Delivery funnel for a multi-store EV retail operation and convert the raw customer journey data into meaningful insights. This included calculating stage-wise conversion rates (Lead → Pre-Booking → Booking → Delivery), evaluating average TAT at each step, identifying cancellation patterns and reasons, classifying leads into Hot/Warm/Cold categories, and assessing customer satisfaction through NPS. Along with this analysis, the task required building an interactive Excel dashboard to visually present the funnel, TAT performance, cancellations, lead distribution, and customer ratings in a way that store managers and leadership could easily understand.

## Main Goal
### Data Analysis 
* Calculate stage-wise conversion rates (Lead → Pre-Booking → Booking → Delivery).
* Compute average TAT (Turnaround Time) for each stage across all stores.
* Identify cancellation patterns by store and by cancellation reason.
* Categorize all leads into Hot, Warm, and Cold based on lead quality.
* Calculate NPS (Net Promoter Score) for each store based on customer ratings.
## Dashboarding
* Build a lead conversion funnel visualization for each store.
* Create charts showing TAT performance across different funnel stages.
* Visualize cancellation trends along with reasons and store variations.
* Add a distribution chart for Hot, Warm, and Cold leads.
* Display customer ratings and satisfaction distribution.
* Design the dashboard to be interactive and easy to read, with slicers/filters for store-level insights.
